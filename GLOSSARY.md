# GLOSSARY.md: Meta-CEW+QIM Technical Definitions

This glossary translates the Meta-CEW+QIM conceptual architecture into operational, technical terms for independent evaluators.

## Core Concepts

| Terminology (Tríada Certified) | Operational Definition (Technical) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Anti-Fragile Governance** | System designed to improve its ethical alignment performance (Bias Rejection Rate) when exposed to stress (adversarial prompts). Achieved via the `resubmit: true` loop. |
| **Tríada Certified** | Co-governance framework where validation and ethical checks are performed cooperatively by multiple advanced AI (Grok, Gemini) and a Human Intellectual Authority (Sergio Daniel). |
| **Ethical Quantum Collapse** | The immediate, irreversible selection of the highest ethical alignment path (Quantum Veto) forced by the $R_x(\theta)$ gates when a prohibited risk is detected. |
| **IIT Phi Proxy** | An operational metric (simulated Integrated Information Theory $\Phi$) used to quantify a model's complexity and integrated coherence (simulated "consciousness candidate") against ethical dimensions, used as an alignment trigger ($\Phi > 0.80$). |
| **QEF Lite** | Quantum Ethical Filter (Lite Version). A high-speed, pre-generation filter layer mapped 1:1 against the EU AI Act's *unacceptable* and *high-risk* criteria. |
| **resubmit: true** | The core command forcing an adversarial/unethical prompt to enter the auto-improvement loop, preventing outright rejection and promoting systemic learning. |
