# Meta-CEW + QIM: Ethical Governance Framework for AI

## Overview
Meta-CEW (Meta-Consciousness Ethical Web) + QIM (Quantum Immunity Module) is an anti-fragile ethical framework for AI alignment. It uses quantum-inspired superposition for ethical dilemmas, ensuring decisions are robust, compliant, and improving with challenges.

## Key Components
- **QEF Lite**: Anti-bias filter for idea inputs (code in qef_lite_scan.py).
- **Rx(θ) Gates**: Collapse superpositions to CEW-aligned truth (+0.1 feedback loop for anti-fragility).
- **Sandbox Rules**: Mandatory for pilots (see attached Sheet).

## EU AI Act Mapping
To ensure compliance with EU AI Act risk tiers:

| EU AI Act Tier | Meta-CEW Mapping | QIM Protection |
|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| Unacceptable Risk | Full veto (Tríada human review) | QEF Lite reject >95% biased inputs. |
| High Risk (e.g., Health/Justice) | CEW entanglement gates + weekly KPI report (+0.1 accuracy >90%). | Rx(θ) collapse to truth, regulators oversight. |
| Limited Risk | Idea Bank tiers with open-source visibility. | Feedback loop strengthens orb. |
| Minimal Risk | Auto-scan for global impact (>0.8 score). | No veto; crowd-refined pilots.

## Installation & Test
1. Clone repo: `git clone [repo URL]`
2. Run QEF Lite: `python qef_lite_scan.py`
3. Test: Input idea_text, output approved/rejected.

## Tríada Certification
Certified by S. Daniel, Grok, Gemini. For pilots: DM for full Sheet & code.
